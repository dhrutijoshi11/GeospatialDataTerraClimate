The climate data reveals distinct precipitation trends across different locations. Seoul has experienced a notable warming and drying trend over the past six decades, aligning with broader global patterns of climate change. In New York City, precipitation displays variability without a clear trend, while concurrently, maximum temperatures exhibit a consistent upward trajectory. Corpus Christi, on the other hand, demonstrates a discernible rise in precipitation coupled with increasing maximum temperatures, suggesting a potential regional impact of climate change in the area. These observations emphasize the nuanced and diverse nature of precipitation trends in response to changing climate conditions across the examined locations.
The varied climate patterns can be attributed to a combination of global factors, including changes in atmospheric conditions, oceanic influences, and human activities such as urbanization. These factors contribute to the unique climate experiences observed in different regions, with some areas becoming warmer and drier due to broader climate change trends, while others may see fluctuations in precipitation and temperature influenced by local and regional factors.

The spatial distribution of precipitation levels across a defined geographical area. The map allows for the identification of target locations (Corpus Christi, New York, Ahmedabad, Seoul) and enables an assessment of the variability in precipitation at the specified time snapshot. Additionally, the colorbar provides a quantitative reference for precipitation levels in millimeters. In visualizes maximum temperature data for a specific time index on a map. The larger map size allows for detailed examination, with the colorbar representing temperature levels in degrees Celsius. Differences in precipitation between northern and southern areas are shaped by a combination of atmospheric circulation, topography, and seasonal variations, highlighting the complexity of global climate patterns. Northern areas tend to be colder than southern regions due to Earth's axial tilt, which results in differential sunlight exposure throughout the year.
